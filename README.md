MoleSvn
=======

MoleSvn is a SVN client frontend for the BeOS/Zeta operating system, implemented as a Tracker extension. zlib/libpng License.

Yes, this is ironic to have a SVN client stored in a Git repo, but hey, it could be used as the base for a Git GUI.

## Compiling on Haiku

Run the following commands in MoleSVN directory:

```
make
cp objects.x86-cc2-release/MoleSVN  ~/config/non-packaged/add-ons/Tracker/
```
